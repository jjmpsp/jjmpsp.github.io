So recently I‚Äôve been&nbsp;working on a website where one of the requirements is that it&nbsp;must have a strong connection with&nbsp;the brand‚Äôs social media presence. This means that a user coming to the website must be able to explore and interact with the brand‚Äôs social media content without having to leave the current page.
I‚Äôve currently implemented the Instagram image embed widget&nbsp;to interact with individual posts, made use of the Facebook Graph API to get information about a page, looked at Facebook‚Äôs embeddable plugins&nbsp;for Facebook page interactions, and explored&nbsp;Google‚Äôs embeddable badges&nbsp;for interacting with Google Plus entities. But one major social media service appears&nbsp;to be missing ‚Äì Snapchat.

Now although Snapchat is a social media for mobile devices only, it is still dominating the market with over 100 million active users. 400 million snaps are sent daily through the service, and 71% of its users are&nbsp;under 25 ‚Äì making it essential for reaching out to the average teenager by marketers (as seen in the&nbsp;following slideshare presentation):
 
 6 Snapchat Hacks Too Easy To Ignore  from Gary Vaynerchuk

But&nbsp;what does this mean for webmasters? Should we simply ignore any social interaction with Snapchat as there isn‚Äôt an official Snapchat API available? Before, the answer to this would have been Yes!&nbsp;But now the answer to this is No!
A few months ago, Snapchat added a new feature to its mobile apps where users could add friends by scanning their unique ‚ÄòSnapCode‚Äô. A SnapCode is essentially snapchat‚Äôs own implementation&nbsp;of the QR code specification. You can see an example SnapCode in the screenshot below:

If you scan this SnapCode, a friend request will be sent to my personal snapchat account. This could potentially save&nbsp;users from having to manually search for my username using the app.
So how could this be implemented on a website? Well, all you‚Äôd need to do is include an image of your&nbsp;SnapCode inside it within your webpage. Sure, you could go ahead and do this manually by taking a screenshot of your SnapCode&nbsp;in the Snapchat app&nbsp;like I have above, but this isn‚Äôt really ideal if you want a higher resolution image. This is why&nbsp;Snapchat have now simplified this process by creating a website dedicated to generating SnapChat QR codes, or SnapCodes.
Snapchat‚Äôs new website&nbsp;is far from being an API to be able to generate a SnapCode QR codes for any user just yet, but you can freely&nbsp;download your own SnapCode&nbsp;from SnapChat‚Äôs new SnapCode website.
After downloading your SnapCode, you‚Äôll&nbsp;have a zipped&nbsp;file which contains PNG and SVG versions of your Snapcode. You are then able to make&nbsp;customisations to your own SnapCode, but be sure to&nbsp;follow SnapChat‚Äôs&nbsp;guidelines and best practices for modifying the image containing the SnapCode. This is to ensure that the tag still works properly before it is printed or embedded on a website or anywhere else. There will be a PDF specification document inside the zipped folder which can help you with this.
Here‚Äôs an example of a SnapCode I edited earlier:
Original SnapCode:

&nbsp;
Edited SnapCode:

As you can see, I have added my own content inside the Ghost of the Snapchat icon and my unique SnapCode data is still intact inside the image. This could&nbsp;be used for putting your own brand inside the image so users of your service can identify that you exist on Snapchat and add you as a friend if they wish.
This is just one of the ways snapchat has started to expand to reach out to new users. I‚Äôm sure the Snapchat team will&nbsp;be adding plenty&nbsp;more features like this in the future, and an official Snapchat API may soon become available. But for now, we‚Äôll have to sit back and play the waiting game for&nbsp;anything more to be announced.
I hope this post has inspired you to start including Snapchat as a social media on your own websites / posters / videos or whatever you‚Äôre creating. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll start seeing stickers put up in shop windows soon enough if this really catches on!

So who remembers who this &nbsp;classic bearded woman is? Why yes, it‚Äôs&nbsp;Conchita wurst from 2012‚Äôs EuroVision competition.

Today I‚Äôd like to share what‚Äôs probably the most impressive Google Chrome extension I‚Äôve ever seen.

Two clever guys named&nbsp;David Fankhauser and Benjamin Gr√∂ssing&nbsp;have created&nbsp;Wurstify, an extension for adding a ‚ÄòWurst‚Äô beard to every single image on the internet that has a face in it. Pointless, yes. Fun, definitely!
The extension itself seems to make use of some clever face detection algorithms for plotting beards of varying&nbsp;thicknesses on faces. I don‚Äôt know how the authors of the extension are going to handle the masses of traffic coming to their servers when this has a big user base, but for now let‚Äôs just enjoy this tool whilst it lasts.
The authors of the extension claim you can ‚Äòwurstify‚Äô&nbsp;Facebook Friends,&nbsp;News Photos, or even the&nbsp;whole Web (even the darkest corners of it) ‚Äì lol
There‚Äôs not much more to say about this extension, expect go download it from the official chrome extension store and start ‚Äòwurstifying‚Äô your favourite websites!
Here‚Äôs a few examples of the extension in action:
My website with added beards:
My website with added beards
Facebook with added beards:
Facebook with added beards
The BBC website with added beards:
BBC website with added beards
And even a Google image result for the Queen with added beards:
A google image search of the queen with added beards
‚Ä¶ I think you you get the point!

For the past 2 weeks I‚Äôve been working on a new website that contains quite a few custom HTML elements. After finishing a huge chunk of the work, I decided to push the project to GitHub, as I usually do for all big projects.
As I went to push the project up to GitHub, I noticed that there were some changes to the repository that had to be pulled first. As tired as I was, I went ahead and pulled these changes without actually realising that I was syncing my work with the incorrect repository! Then I headed off to bed for some well needed sleep.
The next day I came on and freaked out to see that ALL of my work had gone ‚Äì everything. I was like ‚Äúwtf man, has someone been on my laptop whilst I was sleeping and deleted everything?‚Äù. Then I began to investigate.

I opened my project in Finder and noticed that all PHP files were in fact gone from the directory. However, I also noticed that the project folder structure was still intact.
I then opened Sublime Text and noticed that all PHP files were inside the temporary file buffer, all code within them had gone, but they could be saved as empty files. I tried undoing changes, but unfortunately there weren‚Äôt any to undo. Damn.
I then decided to delete the .git folder and re-initialise the repository to see what was going on* (big mistake ‚Äì see later comments).
I then browsed the repository on GitHub and noticed that something strange had happened ‚Äì the repository had merged code with a previous project I was working on. I soon figured that I must have added the wrong repository URL when setting up the repository on my local machine. Damn.
After spending about an hour Googling for a solution, I came to accept that I had lost my work and that I would have to face my mistake and start my project again.
Just as I was about to give up hope, it hit me that Chrome stores cached versions of anything you access within the browser, so I decided to open the cache and see what I could find. I did this by typing the following into the Omnibox in Chrome:
Code block&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chrome://cache/
To my surprise, I found cached versions of every single file/page I had created for the project! I saved those cache files and used this extremely helpful tool&nbsp;to decode the raw binary versions of the cache files back into human readable text.
Now that I had the HTML and CSS back for each file within my project, I began to copy and paste each file back manually until I had a usable project again which navigated to multiple pages. I still had to code all of the PHP within project again, but this was nothing more than setting up a few URL routes, which only took a few hours. A few hours is still a long time, but it certainly beats rewriting everything from scratch!
So, how could this issue been completely prevented? Well, here are a few tips I would suggest doing whilst working on a project:

Backup. We‚Äôve heard it a million times before, but we still don‚Äôt do it. You can do this by zipping your project every now and then, then archiving it safely on an external storage device or cloud service.
Turn on the autosave feature in your text editor. My text editor of choice is Sublime text which supports automatic backups of your projects.
Leave Google Chrome to cache files so you can recover data. This is what really saved my ass in this particular instance.
Don‚Äôt re-initialise a git repository if something does mess up. You can always rollback to a previous commit to recover your work. This is something that I completely forgot about before deleting the .git folder!
Always confirm that you‚Äôve added the correct remote URL of a repository before pushing up your code. You can do this by typing the following command into your terminal:

Code block&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git remote -v
This will list both, your fetch and push repository locations so you can confirm that they‚Äôre correct.
&nbsp;
Code block&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;origin https://github.com/jjmpsp/xxx.git (fetch)
&nbsp;
origin https://github.com/jjmpsp/xxx.git (push)
&nbsp;
I hope you found the tips in this post useful and you can recover your web project if it has been lost, for whatever the reason may be.
Cheers,
Joel

So we‚Äôre now into 2014 and websites are starting to become way more advanced by implementing new technologies such as AJAX, fancy web forms and even web sockets.&nbsp;However, little do webmaster‚Äôs realise that they‚Äôre opening a space for huge security flaws within their websites / web applications / web services for malicious hackers to take advantage of.&nbsp;It could be that a hacker wants to take down your service just for the fun of it, or maybe you‚Äôve become a serious business competitor of theirs and so they want to take down your service as soon as possible so they start making more sales. Or maybe a hacker just thinks they have balls because they can actually do this kinda thing behind a keyboard ‚Äì when in fact they‚Äôd probably soil themselves right in front of you if you tracked them down and confronted them asking why they hacked your website :p
There are many reasons why you should be extremely cautious about web security, but that isn‚Äôt what this post is about ‚Äì so let‚Äôs move on.
In this post I will discuss the top 5 security flaws I see way too often on the web. I will also give some pointers on how to learn more about these exploits and fix them so your web applications no longer get hacked.

Security flaw #5:
Ajax security exploits
Ajax is a cool technology, but one major problem with it is that people who are implementing it into their websites don‚Äôt really understand some of the potential security flaws that pop up from using it.
One rule when creating backend systems:
Never allow user input‚Ä¶ If you do, clean the input or do some sort of error checking with it so that it isn‚Äôt possible for users to perform malicious operations on your web server!
You should always keep this rule in mind when developing backend code.
Sample ajax exploit vulnerability
Recently, I was messing around with a pretty cool theme changer I found on a website showing off HTML 5 and CSS3 website designs. The website itself looked fantastic, but it‚Äôs coding turned out to be a nightmare‚Ä¶ I decided to take a look at how the theme changer worked, and to my surprise, it turned out that it sent out an ajax request that set a cookie, followed by another ajax request to read a php file directly from the server‚Äôs disk, included it into the page so that the PHP pre-processor rendered it on the fly and then used Javascript&nbsp;to append the rendered html to the page‚Äôs DOM. This may seem like a clever method of creating such a script, but this is extremely unsafe.
I was able to perform a Directory Traversal Attack on the server and display the entire contents of it just by going up a few directories. A hacker could do a lot with information about your server, and could potentially screw things up so you have no option but to completely rebuild your server.
Assuming the vulnerable script looked something like this:
vulnerable-script.php (server side)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php
$template = 'html5-green-theme.php';
if (isset($_COOKIE['TEMPLATE']))
$template = $_COOKIE['TEMPLATE'];
include ("/home/users/username/public/templates/" . $template);
?&gt;
I could send the following http web request along with a modified cookie (making the server think that this is a genuine request):
HTTP request exploiting the vulnerable file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GET /vulnerable-script.php HTTP/1.0
Cookie: TEMPLATE=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
Boom! We are now able to read any file on a server, or display users of the server ‚Äì making it easier for us to hack other things.
Advice on how to fix this security flaw:
Just don‚Äôt use a cookie for implementing this type of functionality. A simple solution to this problem would be just storing the source of the html file in a database field, rather than reading the file directly from a disk. If you must use an include in this way though, just add some validation for checking if the script should be allowed to include files from a certain directory or something.
&nbsp;
Security flaw #4:
SQL injections
One of the most common attacks on websites is SQL injections. You‚Äôd think by now that they‚Äôd finally start to disappear, but people still tend to forget about them or use deprecated functions (functions that should no longer be used as there are better solutions available) and so huge security holes are opened up to user &amp; application data!
Examples of an SQL injection attack:
There is a fantastic wiki entry on SQL injections, so I‚Äôm just going to link you there instead.
All I‚Äôm saying is don‚Äôt create queries like this, or you‚Äôre just asking for trouble:
Vulnerable SQL code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$someVariable';
Why you ask? read the wiki entry, it‚Äôll explain SQL injection to you way better than I will.
Advice on how to fix SQL injection security flaws:

Use prepared statements for your queries. Prepared statements are safer than using the standard mysql() functions as they automatically filter user inputs wherever you specify. PDO is an Object Orientated abstraction of native database drivers, so it‚Äôs compatible with many database technologies (not just mysql). This makes managing your code easier if you ever decide to port your script for another DBMS software.

PDO database query&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Instantiate a new PDO object
$db = new PDO('mysql:dbname=user_management;host=localhost');
// Prepare a query for being escaped
$statement = $db-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email');
// execute the query, passing in the parameters to replace
$statement-&gt;execute(array(':email' =&gt; $email));
// fetch results as array
$results = $statement-&gt;fetchAll();

Turn off errors from the php configuration, or just be lazy and use the following code at the top of your source files:

Turn off PHP error reporting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php
	error_reporting(0);
?&gt;
This stops people from seeing that a table doesn‚Äôt exist, and so it makes it harder to ‚Äòguess‚Äô table names or perform blind SQL injection attacks.

Don‚Äôt make your table names really obvious. E.g. ‚Äòtbl_passwords‚Äô is more likely to be guessed in a few tries, compared to ‚Äòsuper_long_table_name_passwords‚Äô. This obviously adds some complexity to your website / web application, but it really does make it harder for hackers to perform blind SQL injection attacks on your service ‚Äì if they ever do find a vulnerability within it.
Hash passwords and encrypt sensitive data. This is a no brainer really, but older systems still tend to store data in plain text! I actually gained entry into a pretty big education system created by my local council a few years ago. I only did this to prove a point that it could be done ‚Äì I was however rather shocked to find plaintext passwords displayed in their database along with my personal email address! This really made me up my game with security of data. Oh and they promised me an award for finding this exploit too ‚Äì which I never got‚Ä¶ Awww. 

&nbsp;
Security flaw #3:
Dynamically coding user id‚Äôs into forms.
A lot of people will wonder why this ‚Äòexploit‚Äô is even at number 3 within this list, but believe it or not, I tend to see this a lot whilst browsing website source code. Allow me to demonstrate.
Assuming we have the following exploitable html form:
Exploitable html form&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;form action="update-email.php" method="POST"&gt;
	&lt;input type="text" name="new_email"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="3373"&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" value="Update my email address"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
It looks harmless, right? Wrong. By having that ‚Äòuser_id‚Äô field in there, you are basically allowing anyone to change anyone else‚Äôs email address. So what you‚Äôre saying? It‚Äôs just an email address linked to my account right? Yeah possibly (depending on your system) but does your website contain a recover password function too? If it does, you‚Äôve just allowed anyone to gain access to another users account in seconds!
Even Facebook were vulnerable to this type of attack a few months ago! Crazy right? You‚Äôll be happy to know that the exploit doesn‚Äôt work any longer, but you can read about how this hack happened on the exploit author‚Äôs blog.
How to prevent from these types of hacks within my system?

Don‚Äôt include a user_id field within forms!
Depend on a session instead.

&nbsp;
Security flaw #2:
Cross site scripting (XSS) attacks
Do you have a comment form on your website? Yes? Are you validating all inputs as much as possible? No? Well I suggest that you fix this right now as you are prone to users executing Javascript on your page without your knowledge!
Cross site scripting example
Imagine I posted the following string of text as a comment to a website:
Simple XSS demo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;
alert("Hello random user");
&lt;/script&gt;
If the website doesn‚Äôt prevent against XSS attacks then I would get a lovely alert box like the following every time that page was visited:

By this point your website users are gonna be like ‚Äúwuuut? how did that happen?‚Äù But in fact, this is actually just the start of the attack. An attacker could go way further than this and steal cookie data from a client‚Äôs browser with the following code:
Cross site scripting example&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;
	alert(document.cookie);
&lt;/script&gt;
I recently discovered a slightly more complicated exploit than this on a social networking website called&nbsp;Unii. The funny thing is that I managed trigger 380 calls of my exploited code in just a few hours! Now I‚Äôm not the type of person that would hack a website in this way, but I could have easily stole 380+ accounts in no time. I reported this exploit to the website administrator and suggested a fix for them.
How to prevent XSS (Cross Site Scripting)?
Within PHP it‚Äôs really simple. Just do this every time you‚Äôre echoing a string:
Prevent XSS attacks with PHP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php
$string = '&lt;script&gt;alert("Hello random user");&lt;/script&gt;';
echo htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
?&gt;
&nbsp;
Security flaw #1:
Sloppy coding and lack of code testing.
Yes, that‚Äôs right. The main reason people are hacking your website is because you‚Äôre just not testing your code enough before you release it to the wild.
Here are a few pointers that I have for people to create better code for the web:

Create automated tests.
Ask real people to test your application.
Get a decent browser such as Google Chrome and use the network inspection tool to monitor traffic, ensuring no sensitive data is transferred between requests.
Create a test site on another domain with the same server setup. Always remember to protect the test site from being accessed by non testers. A good way around this is creating an I.P whitelist.
Always test the unexpected. Not everyone uses your system in the same way.
Always add limits to functions. E.g. Why would a user need to guess their password 5 times in the space of 1 minute? Is there a bot trying to brute force account credentials?
Always Google for multiple code examples and compare your code against them. If your code contains segments from each example you find, chances are it‚Äôs going to be less prone to errors.
Research information security every now and then. I like to keep an eye on the Information Security website over at StackExchange and look at some of the questions people ask.

Post conclusion:
Perfecting any sort of web project takes a lot of time and patience. I have been working on websites for over 6 years now and I still tend to find new ways of exploiting them.
Hopefully this post will inspire some of you to think more about your coding style and start writing better code to accommodate for some of the unusual (or unthought of) scenarios that I have pointed out above. You should use this post as a reference for when you‚Äôre developing new ideas to accommodate for stopping some of the most common website attacks.
Of course there are many other exploits out there, but these are just some of the more common ones that I tend to come across within websites.
My next post will be a guide on how to create the perfect development workflow with GitHub and an Apache server without any user interaction. This post will also cover more security related aspects of web development, so if you liked this post be sure to check it out 
Thanks for reading!
DISCLAIMER: I only research security vulnerabilities for my own benefit. I am sharing this information with you so that you have a general security checklist for when developing new websites or services.&nbsp;You should not use these methods for performing unlawful attacks on vulnerable websites. Instead, you should notify webmaster's of the security flaw(s) in their website and point them into the right direction on how to fix their coding mistakes. A link to this post would be a good starting point ;)

During August 2013 I took part in an event called Young Rewired State. This was my third year taking part in the event, but my first as a mentor.

I have blogged about Young Rewired State before on my old blog, but just in case you are unaware of what the event is here‚Äôs a brief description:
Young Rewired State is a week long event for Young coders (18 or under) based in the United Kingdom. The aim of the event is to get more young people coding and  interacting with open government datasets.
Previously, the Cardiff Young Rewired State event had been held at Sequence, however this year it was held at Box UK.
This year I helped create an app called Growify (click for demo). Growify is an online based plant management tool which makes use of a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, and some special hardware that we hacked together with the help of an electronics hobbyist from BT. The hardware was programmed using C and Python and made use of a Ruby backend REST API web server which our custom built hardware sent out http web requests to at specified intervals. The idea was that consumers could then plant our hardware into their plants / shrubs / crops and track particular information about the life of their plant. Some of the data that we managed to track included moisture, humidity, and temperature levels. Open data involving the weather and pollution zones were also implemented into the app to make it more complete and relevant to the Young Rewired State brief. All of this information could be visualised within an online dashboard in live time and a user could track further plants by adding them to their plants collection within their account. 
Being an ex-gardner I saw some potential in Growify for those who are looking to grow their own plants but absolutely suck at it. Growify would be an excellent all in one budget solution for those that simply don‚Äôt have enough money for the specialist equipment which assists with growing plants. Unfortunately though, none of the members within the Growify team continued working on the app beyond the week because of distance restrictions. This is a real shame but nonetheless Growify was still an excellent idea. 
Growify has since been made open source just in case you‚Äôd like to take a look at the code. 
If you‚Äôd like to know more about my time at Young Rewired State, I wrote an in depth guest post for Box UK explaining what I had gained out of the week from volunteering as a mentor.
All in all, this year was a great year for Young Rewired State in Cardiff and I can‚Äôt wait to take part in the event again next year and see what other amazing ideas we can come up with.
